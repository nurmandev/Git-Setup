# Tom & Jerry Git Collaboration Project

## üìå Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the importance of a **Version Control System (VCS)**, specifically **Git**, in collaborative software development.  

Using **Tom and Jerry** as an example scenario:  
- **Tom** updated the homepage with his own section.  
- **Jerry** added contact information in the footer.  
- Both changes were made on the same file, but thanks to Git, the contributions were tracked, managed, and merged without overwriting each other‚Äôs work.  

This project highlights how Git prevents conflicts, preserves history, and allows teams to collaborate efficiently.
